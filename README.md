Hello

This is a compiler for the IBM XPL language (see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPL). For a while IBM made a compiler available for this system programming language and then they stopped. 

This compiler compiles the IBM XPL syntax into S/390 code. 

It is supplied as is, without any gurantee. 

thanks
