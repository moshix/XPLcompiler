A Compiler for the iBM XPL language
===================================

This is a compiler for the IBM XPL language (see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPL). For a while IBM made a compiler available for this system programming language and then they stopped. 

This compiler compiles the IBM XPL syntax into S/390 code. This compiler is written in IBM PL/I which is an industry semi-standard. It has compiled on my z/OS 2.1 system with the IBM Enterprise PL/I compiler 4.3.1 just fine. 

It is supplied as is, without any gurantee.
